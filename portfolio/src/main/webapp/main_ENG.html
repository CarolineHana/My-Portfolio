           	    <p> Hello Readers, <p>
        		<p> Im Caroline Hana and this is my Blog! Im a 18 year old 
                college student currently living in NYC. I currently attend 
                school at Princeton University, but I say that loosely 
                because we’re all home right now. This
                blog is part of a project series within the Google Student 
                Training in Engineering Program. </p>

                    <span id= "more">
      	        	<p class="tab"> A lot of things in my life have shaped me. I am first
                    generation student  in my family who all have immigrated 
                    from Egypt. I loved growing up within my culture, I enjoy 
                    the traditions, the food, the people and the unique humor 
                    I was raised with. But I don’t think I would be proud of
                    my family’s foreign status if it wasn't for New York City.
                    I am lucky to have grown up in Queens, New York, known as
                    the most diverse place in the world. Being around a plethora 
                    of cultures I never felt like the “other”, everyone freely 
                    expressed culture and were accepting of others. These cultures 
                    often condense into their own neighborhoods and have stores 
                    and restaurants solely dedicated to them. Most people are aware
                    of larger ethnic neighborhoods like Little Italy or Chinatown, 
                    but there are dozens more! Koreatown, Little Guyana, Little India,
                    Little Poland, and The Middle East of Queens are just a few
                    colloquially known areas. The food in these areas are also
                    unbelievable! Growing up in the city encouraged me to meet new
                    people and curious to  learn about their backgrounds, the stories 
                    are endless. </p>

                <h4>Okay I wasn't actually in the WWE... but I did do wrestling!</h4></h2>
                <h5> Jun 23, 2020 </h5>

     	         <p class="tab"> “Hey don’t break your face on the mat today!” <br>
                  As if my fear wasn’t through the roof already, my father’s 
                  statement quite easily cemented my enormous anxiety for my 
                  first wrestling match that day. But let me explain. For some 
                  students, freshman year  is when you find your place, but 
                  for me It was when I dove head first into new experiences.
                  Despite being incredibly unathletic I  decided that sophomore 
                  year would be the first time I tried a new sport -- wrestling. 
                  Not a lot of girls were on the team and I was probably the 
                  most unfit. I fumbled on every move and in the first week alone
                  I got bruises in twenty places and unimaginable soreness. The 
                  jokes my friends made about my upcoming “big WWE showcase” didn’t 
                  help much either. I was certain that I wanted to quit, but I 
                  continued attending each practice leading up to my first match.</p> <br>
		         <p class="tab"> One mat, one referee, two wrestlers and a whole crowd just 
                  watching,robotics competitions didn’t even feel as nearly 
                  intimidating as this. I ended up not performing my best that 
                  competition day but I continued the season, ending with a total
                  of 4 match wins, a bunch of new friends and a whole new sense of 
                  confidence. Without wrestling literally and figuratively with my 
                  fears I never would’ve been the confident person I am now. Also
                  with the career I intend to pursue, wrestling helped me become 
                  comfortable with taking risks and tackling problems bigger 
                  than I expect. </p>

                <h5> Jun 24, 2020 </h5>     
                   <img class= "blogimg" src="/Images/content-photos/photograph.gif" alt="Me and my camera" height:"300">
                   <span id= "more2">
      	        	<p class="tab"> I remember the first time I held a real camera. It was
                    6th grade and I was at my school's basketball game sitting
                    next to my friend who took photos for the school newspaper.
                    She would take pictures every so often with the dinosaur of
                    a camera to capture the game as her assignment. I didn't pay 
                    much attention to the constant camera shutters until she asked
                    me to take some photos while she got snacks. I agreed, but
                    immediately regreted it, there were so many confusing random
                    buttons and settings. "Just point the camera and shoot" my friend
                    said as she quickly walked away before I objected.</p> <br>
                   <p class="tab"> I peered through the view finder as I waited for the right 
                    moment to take a photo. Immediately he crowd starts cheering as a player 
                    sprints down the court to the basket. This was the moment. And quickly 
                    I raised the camera and clicked. There it was: the player mid-air 
                    about to dunk captured in a split second; the perfect shot. I was so amazed
                    and eventually the photo ended up on the front page of the newspaper! 
                    Exilerated by the idea of "capturing the perfect moment, I started to 
                    take pictures all the time with my phone. I'm not going to lie,
                    I was terrible in the beginning but I was having so much fun trying 
                    different techniques and composing images.In high school I eventually 
                    bought myself a Canon camera and started to build my portfolio by carrying
                    my camera with my everywhere. Soon people from my high school started 
                    offering to pay me for taking their profile pictures after school
                    (I made some good money). Sophmore yeat I decided to make a website 
                    (just like this one!) to publish my photos and my family and friends loved it 
                    so it's active till this day. Actually all of the photos on this webpage
                    are ones taken by me(thats me in the gif!)</p> <br>
                   <p class="tab"> I'm definitely not a professional photographer. There are several
                    skills and techniques I have yet to experiment with, but thats exciting for me. The 
                    moment you take a photo and get that perfect lighting or perfect moment of 
                    laughter is satifsying. Photos elicit so many emotions, memories and meanings
                    and I continue to explore this in my work. Check out the gallery to see some 
                    of my work!

      	        	<p class="tab"> With working parents, I learned to adapt 
                    to solitude by becoming Creator Caroline. My partner in 
                    crime in those periods being an old engineering kit tossed 
                    aside by her disinterested brother. The words “designed for 
                    serious constructors only” printed on on the packaging would 
                    be something I overlooked as a beginner. Fingers cramped tightening
                    tiny screws and following head throbbing instructions distracted 
                    me from school stress. Hours working on model cars, trains, and 
                    cranes, meant hours spent just to remove the musty metallic stench
                    from my hands. Yet after I heard the whirling of the mini engine 
                    and the small ticking gears, the agonizing process became irrelevant.
                    I would flaunt my creations to tired faces after work,proudly 
                    showcasing the small crane I engineered to lift a pencil and keys 
                    or my mini car zoom over stacks of paper.</p><br>
                   <p class="tab"> In high school robotics, life-size metal 
                   mechanisms replaced plastic childhood kits. No longer at 
                   the mercy of toy company selected designs, I was through the
                   age of incoherent instruction manuals. Only my own capability 
                   could limit me. In a shop hidden in an unsuspecting high school
                   basement, I spoke comfortably among deafening machines and wafts 
                   of wood in the air. I found a space where my charismatic and 
                   creator sides met. I clinged to this new sense of optimism, adhering 
                   to a label that encompassed all my facets and not just one 
                   side of my personality.</p> <br>
                   <p class="tab"> The days would eventually become weeks of 
                    constant ear ringing noise and evening train rides home. 
                    Each year the ¨dreambot¨ would lead to many obstacles, but
                    that didn’t stop us from making it to championships 2 years 
                    in a row and going to Michigan(which was probably the highlight
                    of my senior). Commanding a group of confused rookies before 
                    competition is no easy task. That hour of directing frantic
                    young engineers to fix the kinks of our “dreambot” unleashed 
                    my authoritative voice and mechanical jargon of the new Caroline.
                    I wasn’t given the instruction manual, I wrote it. I wasn’t the 
                    silent contributor in a group, my opinions mattered. I no longer
                    feared criticism, I valued constructive discussions. Those moments
                    redefined me; I realized I wanted to do something big or rather 
                    I will do something big.
