            <p> Hello Readers, <p>
        	<p> Im Caroline Hana and this is my Blog! Im a 18 year old 
                college student currently living in NYC. I currently attend 
                school at Princeton University, but I say that loosely 
                because weâ€™re all in online and home right now. This
                blog is part of a project series within the Google Student 
                Training in Engineering Program. </p>
