            <h2> ME </h2>
            <p> Hi Friends! Im Caroline Hana and this is my blog! Im a 18 year old 
                college student currently living in NYC. I grew up with immigrant 
                parents from Egypt (which is why this site is also in arabic) and
                an older brother. My mother and father are hard working people who
                have molded everything about me by teaching me and encouraging my
                driven passions. My brother equally has been my partner in crime
                in helping me overcome challenges with being confident, and being
                willing to mistakes by trying new things.<br>
                I currently attend school at Princeton University to study electrical 
                engineering,but I say that loosely because weâ€™re all 
                home right now. Any way I hope you this blog can pass the and time
                and youcan enjoy it while learning more things about me. <br> 
                This blog is part of a project series within the Google Student 
                Training in Engineering Program. </p>
    
            <h3> About </h3>
            <h2> My Background </h2>
        	<p> Growing up  during times of boredem I found my playing with a 
                used and passed down engineering kit, making working cars and 
                helicopters. This small hobby would encourage me to join the
                all girls robotics team in high school as part of the construction
                team. Robotics helped me grow to express myself and ideas more 
                confidently in public, become a more creative problem solver,
                and make some awesome friends who were all incredibly talented.
                Of course using dangerous power tools was also a plus :). Going 
                to college I knew I want to continue a carrer close to robotics 
                and engineering. After doing Google's CSSI program last summer in 
                NYC I was able to decide to pursue electrical engineering at Princeton.
                Although my experience with CS is limited I'm excited to explore 
                what I can create.
                </p>

            <h2> My Projects </h2>
            <p> During my time at CSSI last summer we had one week to make a webapp 
                that we thought is helpful and useful. My group and I decided to
                make a video game called Shell-man. It was essentially a spin off 
                version of PAC-MAN but with a turtle as PAC-MAN and plastic bags
                as the ghosts. If the turtler touched on of the plastic bags 
                the game was over. It was essentially meant to bring awareness
                to the dangers pollution and more specifically ocean pollution 
                brings to sea life. The webapp also came with an actual website
                where people could find facts and resources about ocean pollution
                and enviromental protection. The whole game was coded in javascript
                which was difficult to complete in just a week, but I think it 
                turned out amazing and Im really proud of my group!
